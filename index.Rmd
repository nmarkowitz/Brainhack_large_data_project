```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

As tools and data primarily used by researchers move into the hands of clinicians, such tools and data must be made readily accessible and easy to use. Visualizations and graphics, acting as an index and accommodated by brief descriptors, are a powerful method to allow clinicians readily access and understand large data.

### Who's using the data?

There's a diversity of backgrounds among those using this data for clinical purposes. A standardized and easy to use way to allow all professionals to utilize this data becomes a great benefit.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

### How can we make it transferable?

A tree diagram, interactive and visualizing standardized output, has potential to make large data easily understood. Below is an interactive tree that would allow sharing and organization of data easier. It would also allow data to be less prone to naming and file placement errors.
